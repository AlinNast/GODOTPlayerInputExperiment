# GODOTPlayerInputExperiment

### This is a Basic Implementation of 3 different control option for a player character.
  1. A snappy instant feedback, with a exagerated coyote time. While its the most un realistic the Users that tested this one seem to prefer it it looks like it mathes the expectations regarding the behaviour.

  2. A "realistic" behaviour where velocity is increased by acceleration, coyote time and jump charge time are set to match the average human reaction time ( 0.25 s), while this is my favorite, it seems other users that tested it found it hard to control

  3. Ease in ease out acceleration pattern, This acceleration pattern is rather usefull for annimations, but in character locomotion it feels unrealistic. 

### Lessons learned in thi project.
 - Applying math formulas directly into code to see direct feedback on the player.
 - Expereimenting with 3 extreme methods of controlling the player to see reactions from other users and judge what feels better.
